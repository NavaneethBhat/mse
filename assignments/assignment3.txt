Q1> Explore the DVM instructions and prepare a summary of the same atleast for 5 instructions in a detailed format

Instruction 1
Name : aget
Syntax : aget vx,vy,vz
Description: Gets an integer value of an object reference array into vx. The array is referenced by vy and is indexed by vz.
Example : 4407 0306 - aget v7, v3, v6
		  Gets an integer array element. The array is referenced by v3 and the element is indexed by v6. The element will be put into v7.

Instruction 2
Name : goto
Syntax : goto label
Description: Unconditional jump to the label by an offset of type short.
Example: 28F0 - goto 0005 // -0010
		 Jumps to current position-16 words (hex 10). 0005 is the label of the target instruction.

Instruction 3
Name: execute-inline 
Syntax : execute-inline {parameters},inline ID
Description : Executes the inline method identified by inline ID
Example : EE20 0300 0100 - execute-inline {v1, v0}, inline #0003
		  Executes inline method #3 using v1 as "this" and passing one parameter in v0.

Instruction 4
Name : xor-type
	   where type may be long,int
Syntax: xor-int vx, vy, vz
		xor-long vx, vy, vz
Description : Calculates the vy XOR vz and puts the result into vx.(Only type is different for above instructions)
Example : (long type)
		  A206 0002 - xor-long v6, v0, v2
		  Calculates v0,v1 XOR v2,v3 and puts the result into v6,v7

Instruction 5
Name: return
Syntax : return vx , return-void
Description : returns the value vx 
		      return-void returns nothing
Example : 0F00 - return v0
		  Returns with return value in v0.

Q2> Differentiate between mobile and cloud computing

Differences are listed in orders of numbers.

Mobile Computing.
1. Mobile computing is humanâ€“computer interaction by which a computer is expected to be transported during normal usage. Mobile computing involves mobile communication,   mobile hardware, and mobile software. 
2. It involves Comparatively lesser computational capacity.
3. Computation is possible even in offline.
4. Typically involves handheld devices, laptops, tablets etc.

Cloud Computing.
1. The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.
2. The distributed software systems are powerful enough to carry out complex calculations.
3. Every single task needs the internet.
4. Internet of things are empowered by cloud.

Q3> Give an example of an application simulating an environment of context aware computing and justify.

 "Behaving" by "understanding" on the scenario can be termed as context aware computing.
 A mobile app that automatically turns the mobile system into silent mode when the user enters a meeting hall can be an example for context aware computing.
 Why?
	Because the mobile user is not directing his device perform any action. Rather the device has "understood" the scenario and "behaved" accordingly.
 A mobile screen adjusting its brightness according to the level of brightness around it is also an illustration for context aware computing.
